You can use JRuby with [http://www.rubyonrails.org/ Ruby on Rails]!

__TOC__
==Advantages==

Gives Rails the power and functionality of Java Platform:

* Excellent Garbage collection for endless uptimes
* Hotspot profiled dynamic optimizations for great performance
* Access to Java ecosphere for additional technology options
* Deploy to Java App Servers for ubiquity

==Getting Started==

== Deployment ==

=== War File Deployment ===
If you do not use a traditional Ruby application server like mongrel, you can use a Java application server (JAS).  To deploy to a JAS you can use the tool [[Warbler]] to bundle up your Rails application in a Java Web Application Archive (e.g. .war file).  Once you have a .war file you can deploy to any JAS using their war deployment mechanism.  More info:

Here is information of various JAS:
