There are JRuby users all over the world! This is a good thing, too, since there are Ruby, Java, and JRuby conferences, events, and user groups all over the world.

The users listed on this wiki page have volunteered to act as local "JRuby Delegates" when the JRuby core team members are unable to travel. They can answer questions about JRuby, meet up for lunch/dinner/hacking, speak at nearby conferences, and generally act as a local JRuby "expert" for some definition of "expert". You should feel comfortable contacting them directly with questions, and know that they'll either help you or put you in contact with someone who can.

If you are interested in joining this list, we would recommend you meet the following criteria:

* Day to day JRuby user, JRuby committer, or JRuby enthusiast
* Have implemented something interesting or nontrivial using JRuby or contributed nontrivial patches
* Comfortable with open-source ethos
* Comfortable speaking to people, either one on one or as a group (presentation)

In return, the JRuby community will help you fulfill the role of JRuby Delegate, providing speaking tips, presentation material, demos, and more. There's no requirement to start doing conferences, of course; we really just want folks that can help new JRubyists feel comfortable. And of course the JRuby community and the core team are always standing by to assist you.

Note that you can also include your Github or Twitter (or other) information if you'd prefer not to publicize your email here. Just make sure there's a way for folks to contact you, and we're all good!

Welcome to the JRuby Community!
