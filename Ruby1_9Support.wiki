JRuby 1.2 will be the first release of JRuby to officially include large portions of Ruby 1.9's feature set. There's a lot of work to do, however, and we probably won't get it all done in time for the final 1.2 release. There are two areas people really could pitch in: writing specs and helping with implementation.

=Writing Specs=

The new features in Ruby 1.9 are very lightly specified. The RubySpec project has some specs, but there's a lot missing, especially in API areas like String M17N support.

If you're interested in contributing RubySpecs, check out http://www.rubyspec.org for information on how to help out.

=Implementation=

Here's the status of Ruby 1.9 feature support and work remaining:

==Done==

These are done but need more testing. Where noted, pieces are missing.

* Array
** missing encoding aware pack ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3426 JRUBY-3426])
** sort should obey modified Fixnum and String class (but 1.9 still optimizes these case) ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3427 JRUBY-3427])
* Hash
* String
** missing encoding aware % ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3428 JRUBY-3428]), unpack ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3429 JRUBY-3429]), crypt ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3430 JRUBY-3430])
** missing encode/decode (via Encoding::Converter) ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3431 JRUBY-3431])
** possible gotchas with to_sym
** String#hash is not encoding aware yet ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3432 JRUBY-3432])
** string constructions in multiple places in core should taint/set coderanges and encoding
* Symbol
** intern gotchas due to encoding information in symbols (needs to be done)
** might loose encodings in some cases
* Regexp
* Encoding
** missing default_internal/default_external ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3433 JRUBY-3433])
** missing system encoding guess ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3434 JRUBY-3434])
* Enumerable
* Enumerator
** missing next/rewind/with_index (fibers) ([http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-3435 JRUBY-3435])
* Complex
* Rational
* Numeric
* Integer
* Fixnum
* Float
* Range
* Struct
* Kernel (mostly)
* some (most?) of Object, Method, Module, Class
* Thread?
* Fiber?

==Missing==

These are entire areas that need to be worked on.

* Encoding::Converter
* Yielder/Generator
* key Marshal changes
* cli options
* some RubyBignum changes
* possible other changes in Numerics
* changes in Dir/IO/File (some obvious things are done, like enumeratorize)
* some changes in Math
* encoding information in exception messages (now passed via java String)
* BigDecimal changes ?
