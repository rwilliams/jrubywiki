## Fleet control at Oslo Airport Gardermoen
The project monitors and controls the passenger busses and fuel trucks at Oslo Airport Gardermoen.  Each vehicle contains an embedded device with GPS and WIFI that reports the activities of the vehicle to a central server.  Flight list and orders are received by integrating the server to the airport flight database and a central office dispatch unit sends assignments to the vehicles.  All assignments are stored on the server and are reported to the airport authorities through the office backend system.  A web application for analysis and reporting offers detailed drill down and charts.

### Why JRuby?
We had an extremely tight schedule and needed a language that let us write the features quickly.  Ruby fit that need.  At the same time we absolutely needed a tried production platform that would scale well.  Java fit that need.  JRuby seemed a tempting alternative, and all experiments, proof of concept, pre-project and initial iterations of the project proved JRuby to be a really great platform for developing complex and critical applications.

A REALLY important factor that was tested early in the project was the responsiveness of the JRuby team.  The support from the JRuby team has been absolutely fantastic.  Since project start in 2009 and deployment to production in 2010, there have been bugs of differing severities, and each time the JRuby team has responded quickly and reliably.  Over time we have become involved in the JRuby project and we are confident that any problems that occur will be solved.

### How is JRuby Used?
JRuby is used in every tier of the system and large parts of the code is shared across the embedded systems (Android and Linux), thick client office systems (Eclipse RCP), the web apps (Rails), and the communication server (headless JRuby process).

### Java Integration
In the fuel trucks, we use JNI for reading GPIO.  All tiers use ActiveRecord JDBC Adapter for database access, DerbyDB in the client systems, and PostgreSQL on the server.  ActiveMQ is used for integrating to an automated airline ticket reporting system.  The client systems use Eclipse SWT, JFace, and RCP.  Apache POI is used to import Office documents.  Lots more Java libraries are used and work well.  Being able to select from the Java ecosystem in addition to the Ruby gems has proven very valuable.

### Regrets and Recommendations
We have no regrets in choosing JRuby.  It is and has been a very pleasant and productive platform to work on.  As with all projects, be sure to attack your integration points and high-risk parts of your system first.  Test performance.

### Project Metrics
We have around 200 users, 600 assignments per day, 50 vehicles.  The web apps seldom have more that 10 hits/s.

### Why JRuby?
We wanted to move to JRuby from MRI Ruby so we could rewrite some of our slow, CPU-bound code in Clojure.

### How is JRuby Used?
We run Rails on JRuby.

### Java Integration
Although not Java, we are using JRuby's Java integration to call from JRuby into Clojure.

### Regrets and Recommendations

Downsides:

Rails asset recompilation during development is slower.

Cannot use newrelic_rpm gem as it does not clean up thread locals which causes excessive memory usage with tomcat.

Single sign-on with desk.com has stopped working. We have traced this down to what we believe to be an SSL bug in jruby.  See http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-6951

Recommendations:

Do simulate load on a test setup before deploying to production.  We didn't do so at first and we suffered severe performance degradation due to file descriptor and memory leaks.

We recommend Eclipse Memory Analyzer tool for debugging memory leaks.  Gems not cleaning up thread locals has been the biggest source of memory leaks for us.

Avoid haml.  Besides being slower than erb and slim and not supporting streaming, haml uses exceptions for control flow (fixed in upcoming 3.2.0) and changes the values of constants, both of which cause performance issues in jruby.

Be careful with threadsafe mode, especially if you are using a large number of third-party gems.  Many gem authors do not code their gems with thread safety in mind.  JRuby is raising awareness, however.

### Project Metrics
1.4M hits / day.  105K users.
