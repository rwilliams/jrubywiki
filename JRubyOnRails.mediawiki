<h1>JRuby on Rails</h1>
You can use JRuby with [http://www.rubyonrails.org/ Ruby on Rails]. JRuby gives Rails the power and functionality of the Java Platform,  providing it with:
* Excellent garbage collection for endless uptimes
* Hotspot profiled dynamic optimizations for great performance
* Access to the Java ecosphere for additional technology options
* Deployment to Java application servers for ubiquity

=== Deployment ===

==== War File Deployment ====
If you don't use a traditional Ruby application server like [http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ Mongrel], you can use a Java application server.  To deploy to a Java app server, you can use the tool <a href="https://github.com/jruby/warbler">Warbler</a> to bundle your Rails application in a Java Web Application Archive (<tt>.war</tt> file). (Warbler is a minimal, flexible, Ruby-like way to create a <tt>.war</tt> file.) Once you have a <tt>.war</tt> file, you can deploy to any Java app server using its war deployment mechanism.

==== Glassfish v3 Deployment ====
The Glassfish gem by Vivek Pandey enables you to easily deploy a JRuby on Rails application to the Glassfish v3 modularized Java application server. The Glassfish gem wraps the essential technologies in 3 MB and allows you to run your application using a traditional approach, as if you were running Mongrel, Rack, and so on. A brief tutorial can be found here:<br/> [[JRuby on Rails with Glassfish Gem]].
