Communicate: Mailing Lists, IRC
============================================

 _Note: JRuby's mailing lists will soon move to our Kenai.com project. For now, follow the instructions below. We will announce and auto-migrate everyone to the new lists when the time comes._

The JRuby community uses several mailing lists to discuss issues, ask for help, and follow JRuby development:

* **The Users List** hosts general usage discussions, howtos, and help are discussed here.
* **The Developers List** is where folks hacking JRuby and working on deeper integration with other systems can communicate.
* **The SCM List** allows anyone to track JRuby commits and JIRA bug tracker updates. (JIRA is not used any longer.)
* **The Issues List** receives all the new issues created, for lower-traffic tracking of the bug tracker.

To join one or more of the JRuby mailing lists:

* Navigate to [[http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jruby/lists]].
* Click the _Subscribe_ link for any of the lists (it doesn't matter which) and provide your email.
* The Xircles application will send you a confirmation email. Click the link in the email to return to Xircles.
* At [Xircles](http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jruby/lists) choose the subscribe links for the lists you want to subscribe to.

Nabble also has a web archive of both the [jruby-dev and jruby-user email lists](http://ruby.11.x6.nabble.com/JRuby-f3445184.html) and has an excellent interface for searching the lists.

There is a mirror of the jruby-user list at [Google groups](http://groups.google.com/group/jruby-users).
