==Deploying JRuby applications with [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws// Java Web Start]==

===Known Issues===
[http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&query=%22web+start%22+%7C%7C+jnlp+%7C%7C+webstart+%7C%7C+javaws&summary=true&description=true&body=true&pid=11295&status=1&status=3 Open JIRA Issues matching "Web Start or jnlp or javaws"]

===Samples===
The samples directory distributed with JRuby (as of Dec 29 2007 this sample is only on the subversion trunk version of JRuby) has an example jnlp, [http://svn.codehaus.org/jruby/trunk/jruby/samples/jirb.jnlp/ jirb.jnlp] which will start the JRuby Swing IRB console as a Java Web Start application. 

====Getting jirb.jnlp sample to work in Java 1.5====
The [http://svn.codehaus.org/jruby/trunk/jruby/samples/jirb.jnlp/ jirb.jnlp] needs to be modified to work on Java 1.5 because of the use of ".." in the codebase attribute which only works in Java 1.6.
1. make a symbolic link to the directory $JRUBY_HOME/lib in the samples directory (or make a copy of the lib directory).
  $ cd $JRUBY_HOME/samples
  $ ln -s ../lib
2, change the codebase attribute in the jnlp element to use a reference to the local directory
  &lt;jnlp spec="1.0+" codebase="file:."&gt;
3. start the jnlp using javaws from the command line
  $ javaws jirb.jnlp

====New jnlp samples dir====
This Jira issue:
* [http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-2040 JRUBY-2040: new samples/jnlp dir: includes both unsigned and signed examples that work in Java 1.5 and 1.6]
includes an attachment which when extracted in samples/ adds s both unsigned and signed examples that work in Java 1.5 and 1.6. It is projected to be included in JRUBY 1.1 RC2.

===JAR Signing===
If you're getting an <tt>java.securityAccessControlException</tt> with the message <tt>access denied (java.lang.RuntimePermission accessDeclaredMembers)</tt> on startup or when running your JRuby application, then you'll need to sign your jar. The whole process is described 
[http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/1.2/docs/developersguide.html#dev here], under "Signing JAR Files with a Test Certificate". You basically have to perform the following steps:

 keytool -genkey -keystore myKeystore -alias myself
 keytool -selfcert -alias myself -keystore myKeystore

You also need to include to following lines in your jnlp-file:
 &lt;security&gt; 
   &lt;all-permissions/&gt; 
 &lt;/security&gt;

And whenever you modify the jar, you need to do an

 jarsigner -keystore myKeystore test.jar myself

to update the signature.

===Disabling the Security Manager===
If you have a signed jar and the startup fails because of an <tt>java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission</tt> or you continue to have <tt>access denied (java.lang.RuntimePermission accessDeclaredMembers)</tt> errors, you can just disable the security manager:

JRuby:
 java.lang.System.setSecurityManager(nil)
Java:
 System.setSecurityManager(null);
Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on Java Security, so I don't know if disabling the Security Manager has unintended sideeffects. [[User:Mstocker|Mstocker]] 10:49, 30 December 2007 (PST)
