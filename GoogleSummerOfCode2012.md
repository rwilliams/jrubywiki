Google Summer of Code 2012
=========================

This page hosts the ideas for Google Summer of Code 2012! Add your ideas here, improve others, and if you're a student, perhaps something on this list will interest you!

Here's some classic ideas to get you started:

* Native libraries that need a Java port (or wrap a Java lib?)
* JRuby on Android: Ruboto
** Ruboto is working, and has a solid IRB application and tools for generating apps. But there's more we can do, like shrinking the app, improving performance, and building better tooling.
* JRuby for Embedded
** There's a few good JVMs that work on embedded devices, which means there's an opportunity for JRuby to expand into embedded applications.
* Kilim integration
** Kilim provides a fast coroutine implementation that could be used to provide Fibers or other lightweight tasks inside JRuby. Kilim can now weave bytecode so integration with a language like JRuby might now be practical.
