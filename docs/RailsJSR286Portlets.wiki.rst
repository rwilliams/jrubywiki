It is possible to deploy Rails applications so that each controller action is displayed as a standard Java portlet, as specified in the [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=286 JSR286 portlet specification]. This scheme has the advantage of combining Rails applications on J2EE frameworks, such as [http://www.liferay.com Liferay], for rapid development. The user management, page layouts, privileges and other such common application principles can be shifted off the Rails developer to the main framework. The developer can focus on creating unique features straight from the beginning (given that the underlying database has been already modeled).
