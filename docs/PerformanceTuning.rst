Performance Tuning
==================
JRuby supports a number of options to help you tune performance. They range from turning on experimental features to turning off inefficient emulations of Ruby features.This document describes these options and their effects.

Note that before exploring these options, you should spend some time [[Troubleshooting Performance]] to eliminate application or library-level bugs.

Enabling invokedynamic
----------------------

Java 7 brings with it an important new feature called invokedynamic, which greatly improves JRuby's performance on VMs that support it.

Internally, we use invokedynamic in various ways to enable better performance. We limit how much we use it by default because for some users applications the warmup time ends up being longer than they want.  If you want to try and get more performance you can try passing in the options `-Xcompile.invokedynamic=true` to JRuby (or in JRUBY_OPTS) or by setting the jruby.compile.invokedynamic=true property at the JVM level.  This will make more heavy use of invokedynamic and you may see a substantial increase in eventual performance in your application.  We recommend testing your application thoroughly with and without compile.invokedynamic and seeing how your application performs.

Profiling an application
------------------------
JRuby has a built-in profiler that can be used to profile the entire stack all the way down to a single line of code.

* See [[Profiling JRuby]] for more details.

The JVM also has a few profilers built in:

* --sample passed to JRuby or -Xprof passed to the JVM enables the JVM's sampling profiler. This is a very low-cost (and low accuracy) way to find especially egregious hotspots, like stack trace generation mentioned below.

* -Xrunhprof:cpu=times passed to the JVM enables the JVM's global instrumented profiler. This will slow the application tremendously, but measures actual times of all methods running on the JVM. We generally recommend JRuby's profiler (--profile) before using runhprof:cpu=times, or use of the latter only for small, self-contained tests. Results are dumped to java.hprof.txt on exit. Use -Xrunhprof:help for a full set of options.

* -Xrunhprof passed to the JVM will profile all object allocations and record backtraces for those allocations, so you can see if you're creating too many objects. Results are dumped to java.hprof.txt on exit.

In addition to the built-in profilers, there are many third-party tools (some free, some not) that do excellent jobs of profiling. Some also have specialized support for JRuby applications.

For example, [NetBeans IDE](http://netbeans.org) includes a Java profiler (without any specific JRuby support).  See the tutorial [Profiling JRuby with NetBeans
](http://polycrystal.org/2012/10/26/profiling_jruby_with_netbeans.html) for a walk-through on setting up and using the NetBeans profiler.

### Common profiling hotspots

* Stack trace/backtrace generation: Generating backtraces for exceptions, Kernel#caller, etc are more expensive on JRuby due to the way the JVM optimizes.

* Slow or unoptimized methods in JRuby itself: JRuby's not perfect, and once in a while you'll find an especially slow method. Report it to the JRuby team and we'll try to improve it. Remember: JRuby being slower than other implementations is usually a bug.

* Excessive object churn: Ruby is a very GC-intensive language, but with a little care you can reduce object allocation rates substantially. Look at object/allocation profiles to see if you're creating too much junk.

* Systems that don't stabilize: If you're continuing to define constants and methods during the normal runtime of your application, you are likely invalidating the caches that JRuby (and the JVM) uses to optimize code. An ideal system will stop defining new methods and constants at some point and allow the system to stabilize, also known as reaching *steady state*.

Tuning the compiler
-------------------
JRuby's compiler can be enabled in JIT mode or specified to run before execution.

* See [[JRuby Compiler|JRubyCompiler]] for more details.
* See below for [Compiler Runtime Properties](#compiler_rt_props).
* See below for [JIT Runtime Properties](#jit_rt_props).

Don't enable ObjectSpace
------------------------
ObjectSpace has been disabled by default since version 1.1b1. Some users reenable ObjectSpace, using the `-X+O` flag (previously `+O`), without realizing what a massive performance hit this is. If you are running with ObjectSpace enabled, do not expect any sort of performance.

JRuby can be told to run without ObjectSpace by specifying the -O flag as follows:

    jruby -O

There is also a property you can use to disable ObjectSpace:

    jruby -J-Djruby.objectspace.enabled=false

Check the OpenJDK/SunJDK/OracleJDK Code Cache Size
--------------------------------------------------
The "Hotspot" VM that runs all the above-mentioned JVMs has a hard upper limit on how much native (i.e. JIT-compiled) code it will load before disabling JIT completely. If this disabling happens before the meat of your application has been compiled, it will never compile and your performance will suffer.

There are two options to fix this situation: bump up the code cache size; or enable code cache flushing.

The JVM flags of interest are -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=### where the default is 48M, and -XX:+ UseCodeCacheFlushing.

The folks at Atlassian have published a good article on [code cache effects and flushing](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/05/codecache-is-full-compiler-has-been-disabled/).

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Settings
-----------------------------------
Except for the JRuby convenience parameter `--server`, all JVM runtime parameters use the `-J` option, followed by the specific JVM setting. For example:

* Heap space settings: `jruby -J-X<heap-space-setting>`
* JRuby runtime settings: `jruby -J-D<runtime-setting>`

All the settings described in the following sections are JVM settings.

### Using the Java Server Virtual Machine
JRuby benefits greatly from running under the Java **Server** VM, which trades startup and early run performance for a much higher level of long term optimization. JRuby will use the server VM of whatever Java version you're running if you use the `--server` parameter, which passes the `-server` flag to the underlying JVM. For example:

 jruby --server myscript.rb

Combining use of the server VM with using the compiler and disabling ObjectSpace generally results in the fastest performance.

**Note:** The `--server` parameter is a convenient shorthand for the JVM parameter  `-J-server`.

### Setting Heap Space Parameters for JRuby
* Maximum heap space:

    jruby -J-Xmx512m

* Initial heap space:

    jruby -J-Xms512m

* Heap space for Young/Eden Garbage Collection:

    jruby -J-Xmn128m

**All together now**

First some suggestions:

* Set the minimum `-Xms` and maximum `-Xmx` heap sizes to the same value.
* Set the `-Xmn` value lower than the `-Xmx` value.

    jruby -J-Xmn512m -J-Xms2048m -J-Xmx2048m -J-server

### Setting JRuby Runtime Properties
To see all the Java system runtime properties for JRuby, enter the following command in the Command window or Terminal window:
 jruby --properties

All these properties can be used to alter runtime behavior for performance or compatibility. Specify them by passing `-J-Dproperty=value` on the command line. For example:

    jruby -J-Djruby.thread.pool.enabled=true myscript.rb
