JRuby does not support native C extensions, but it does have its own Java native extensions API.  Several gems have implementations of both Java and C extensions rolled into the same gem and those will not be listed here since they will just work.  In some cases there is a JRuby version with a slightly different name or possibly even a totally different name and we list these here so you can update your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'therubyracer', platform: :mri
gem 'therubyrhino', platform: :jruby
```

When there is not an exact match some gems come close enough where a little work on your part can make your application compatible with JRuby.

This page lists common C extensions and JRuby-friendly alternatives you can use to replace them.

If you are interested in helping us port an extension to JRuby, this article is helpful: [Your first Ruby native extension: Java](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2012/08/02/your-first-ruby-native-extension-java/) see also [JRuby examples](https://github.com/jruby/jruby-examples) for a maven build.

<!-- suggestions start -->
| Gem | Suggestions |
|-----|-------------|
|[bson_ext][]|`bson_ext` isn't used with JRuby. Instead, some native Java extensions are bundled with the `bson` gem.|
|[charlock_holmes][]|Use [charlock_holmes-jruby][] instead.|
|[curb][]|[Rurl][] is an example how to implement _some_ of curb's functionality using [Apache HttpClient][]|
|[curses][]|Use [ffi-ncurses][].  ncurses is literal API and lower level than curses|
|[fast_xor][]|use [xorcist][] instead or roll slower but pure ruby equivalent.|
|[image_science][]|Use [image_voodoo][] instead.|
|[kyotocabinet][]|Try using [kyotocabinet-java][] instead. This isn't 100% complete yet, but it covers most of the API.|
|[memcached][]|Try using [jruby-memcached][] instead. Alternatively you can use [jruby-ehcache][], a JRuby interface to Java's (JSR-107 compliant) Ehcache.|
|mysql|Use [activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter][].|
|mysql2|Use [activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter][].|
|[oj][]|Try `gson`, `json` or `json_pure` instead.|
|pg|Use [activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter][] instead or [pg_jruby][] (drop-in replacement).|
|[pry-byebug][]|Use [pry-debugger-jruby][] instead.|
|[RDiscount][]|Use [kramdown][], [Maruku][] (pure Ruby) or [markdown_j][] (wrapper around a Java library)|
|[RedCarpet][]|Same as with **RDiscount** use alternatives such as [kramdown][], [Maruku][] or [markdown_j][]|
|[RMagick][]|Try [RMagick4J][] (implements ImageMagick functionality in Java) or preferably use alternatives [mini_magick][] & [quick_magick][]. For simple resizing, cropping, greyscaling, etc look at [image_voodoo][]. You can also use Java's Graphics2D.|
|sqlite3|Use [activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter][].|
|[therubyracer][]|Try using [therubyrhino][] instead (or [dienashorner][] on Java 8+).|
|[Thin][]| Use [Puma][].|
|[Unicorn][]| Use [Puma][].|
|[win32ole][]|Use the `jruby-win32ole` gem (preinstalled in JRuby's Windows installer).|
|[yajl-ruby][]|Try `json` or `json_pure` instead. Unfortunately there is no known equivalent JSON stream parser.|
|[rugged]| Try using [rjgit]. Not a drop-in replacement, but API is pretty similar|
