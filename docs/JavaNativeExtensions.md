This page should list all known JavaNativeExtensions along with:

1. Why did it need Java native support? (guess is fine)
2. Where is a public repository?

We want to get a reasonably good comprehensive list so that we can improve [[RedBridge]] so that no one needs to use our internal APIs anymore.

## The List
