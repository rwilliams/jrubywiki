adding the jruby-core artifact to your project

    <project>
    ...
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.jruby</groupId>
          <artifactId>jruby</artifactId>
          <version>9.1.13.0</version>
          <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>
    ...
    </project>

for any other build system please see [search.maven.org](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.jruby%7Cjruby%7C1.7.11%7Cjar) for the correct declaration. there is actually also a org.jruby:jruby:jar which is empty, i.e. it is enough to include the pom artifact.

**NOTE:** it is possible to overwrite a dependency used by maven. for example joda-time or snakeyaml but in general older versions might break jruby !!!

        <dependency>
          <groupId>joda-time</groupId>
          <artifactId>joda-time</artifactId>
          <version>2.4</version>
        </dependency>

but on the otherside it can happen that another artifact pulls in an older version of joda-time, snakeyaml, etc and then you need to pick a working version manually as shown above.

to verify your new setup have a look at complete dependency tree
   
       mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose

the verbose option tells you more where and how version conflicts get resolved with maven.

## conflict with ASM version jruby depends on ##

it is possible that the version resolution will pick the wrong version of org.ow2.asm then you can use the artifact org.jruby:jruby-noasm instead.

        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.jruby</groupId>
          <artifactId>jruby-noasm</artifactId>
          <version>9.1.13.0</version>
          <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>

this one has a few artifacts embedded and relocated the package of org.ow2.asm to org.jruby.org.ow2.asm avoiding any conflict with another asm version.

## using snapshot version of jruby ##

there is maven repository [ci.jruby.org/snapshots](http://ci.jruby.org/snapshots) which offers the latest snapshots of current and previous release lines for JRuby. for this you need to add the snapshot repo to your pom.xml (or settings.xml).

TODO ivy and friends

     <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>jruby-snapshots</id>
         <url>http://ci.jruby.org/snapshots/current/</url>
         <releases>
           <enabled>false</enabled>
         </releases>
         <snapshots>
           <enabled>true</enabled>
         </snapshots>
       </repository>
     </repositories>

now you can use like this:

        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.jruby</groupId>
          <artifactId>jruby</artifactId>
          <version>9.2.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
          <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>
