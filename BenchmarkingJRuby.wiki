==Benchmarking JRuby==
The current popular way to benchmark JRuby performance is to perform a gem installation of Rake. The install process exercises a number of APIs and represents a fairly general-purpose application of Ruby. It's also extremely interpreter-heavy.

After getting a build of JRuby, as above, the following steps can be used to benchmark JRuby using Gem and Rake:

*Fetch the current Rake gem from [http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=50 RubyForge]
*Execute the following command (putting JRUBY_HOME/bin in your path or referencing it directly):
 JRUBY_HOME/bin/gem install <rake gem file>
*By preceding this command line with the unix "time" command you can test end-to-end performance. Of course there are other ways to wire in profiling and performance-monitoring tools that won't be detailed here.

A sample run from a MacBook Pro under Apple's Java 6 JVM is shown below:
