Ruby isn't often the subject of research projects. A lot of systems research has used languages like C, C++ and Java. Contemporary programming language research often uses languages like Java, Scala and Haskell. Modern research into VMs and JITs is often based on Java or recently Python.

Very recently I've noticed some papers starting to use Ruby. If you find any others at serious venues, please add them to the list.

# Papers Specifically Using JRuby

## Parallelism

*   W. Ji, L. Lu, and M. L. Scott. [TARDIS: Task-level access race detection by intersecting sets](http://wodet.cs.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wodet2013-final9.pdf). In Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Determinism and Correctness in Parallel Programming (WoDet), 2013.

# Papers More Generally About Ruby

## Concurrency

*   R. Odaira, J. G. Castanos, and H. Tomari. [Eliminating global interpreter locks in Ruby through hardware transactional memory](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/jp-ODAIRA/PPoPP2014_RubyGILHTM.pdf). In Proceedings of the 19th Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP), 2014.

## Static Analysis

*   J. An, A. Chaudhuri, J. S. Foster, and M. Hicks. [Dynamic inference of static types for Ruby](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/papers/popl11.pdf). In Proceedings of the 38th ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), 2011.

*   M. Madsen, P. Sørensen, and K. Kristensen. [Ecstatic – type inference for Ruby using the cartesian product algorithm](http://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/61071016/1181807983.pdf). Master’s thesis, Aalborg University, 2007.

# Papers Using Ruby

## Bioinformatics
