Ruby isn't often the subject of research projects. A lot of systems research has used languages like C, C++ and Java. Contemporary programming language research often uses languages like Java, Scala and Haskell. Modern research into VMs and JITs is often based on Java or recently Python.

Very recently I've noticed some papers starting to use Ruby. If you find any others at serious venues, please add them to the list.
