= Merb =

At the time of writing, Merb 1.0.10 has been released.

Execute the following:
<code>jgem install merb-core merb-more</code>

There're currently Active Record and Sequel ORMs working properly with Merb. Both will require additional jdbc drivers (jgem install postgres-pr for PostgreSQL driver). [[DataMapper]] support is in development.
