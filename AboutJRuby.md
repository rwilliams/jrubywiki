About JRuby
===========

JRuby is a 100% Java implementation of the Ruby programming language. It is Ruby for the JVM.

JRuby provides a complete set of core "builtin" classes and syntax for the Ruby language, as well as most of the Ruby Standard Libraries. The standard libraries are mostly Ruby's own complement of <code>.rb</code> files, but a few that depend on C language-based extensions have been reimplemented. Some are still missing, but we hope to implement as many as is feasible.

See [[Differences Between MRI And JRuby|Differences-Between-MRI-and-JRuby]] for more information on potential incompatibilities between JRuby and the C implementation of Ruby.
